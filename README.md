Personal Website -- Source Code

23/02/2019

This website is built from create-react-app. To run it:
* Install node.js
* Clone this repo to your local machine
* Open command prompt and go inside the root folder of this repo
* Run `npm start`
* Then, open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000

It is a good idea at this point to run `npm update` too, to update all your dependencies.

_General Notes About Create React App_

The build directory holds all of the static data generated by a react build.
You can modify the data inside src, and when you run *npm build*, it will generate this for you.
