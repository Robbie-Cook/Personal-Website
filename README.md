# Personal Website

This is a repository of my personal website [http://robbie.pw](http://robbie.pw), built with React (create-react-app) and Gatsby.

It's a very simple website with a few pages, and it should be updated regularly.

In the near future, I want to make this website smoother with animations. 

Then I want to start making open source contributions to cool projects, and showcase the contributions
on this website.

Then I want a GUI to make updates to, so I can make changes without
having to modify the code, perhaps with Gatsby or Wordpress?

## Features to come
           
* Work on issues 
           
* Potential for CMS integration
               
* Add awesome videos of me playing music
   * Some to process on my phone

### Polishing 
         
* Animations:
   * Elastic ends of pages for mobile
   * Smoother transitions on photos, embedded content
   * Loading animation on pages
