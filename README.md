# Personal Website

This is a repository of my personal website [http://robbie.pw](http://robbie.pw), built with React (create-react-app), Gatsby, and deployed with a static server on Scaleway.

It's a very simple website with a few pages, and it should be updated regularly.

Some key dependencies that this project makes use of are:

* Gatsby.
            A framework for building static react apps with simple server-side rendering, and a good starter for learning good React design practises.
            
* React styled-components.
            I use styled-components a lot in this website. It allows me to apply CSS directly to components, and it
            comes with a SASS-like preprocessor, which allows me to define CSS for child elements      
* Material-UI.
            Currently implementing this for the Navbar (i.e. AppBar, a la material-ui)
            This UI is beautiful and extensible, and has many advantages over bootstrap, which is
            what is being phased out of my website.

In the near future, I want to make this website smoother with animations. 

Then I want to start making open source contributions to cool projects, and showcase the contributions
on this website.

Then I want a GUI to make updates to, so I can make changes without
having to modify the code, perhaps with Gatsby or Wordpress?

## Features to come
* Make sure CI runs on a per-commit level
            
* Work on issues 
           
* Potential for CMS integrated into gatsby?
               
* Add awesome videos of me playing music
   * Some to process on my phone

* 'Project' contribution page for contributed work on open source projects

### Polishing 
         
* Animations:
   * Elastic ends of pages for mobile
   * Smoother transitions on photos, embedded content
   * Loading animation on pages

* ssh with auto certificate renewal

* Blog integration

* Review nav menu -- too generic?
