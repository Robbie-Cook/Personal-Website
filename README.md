# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with React (create-react-app), and deployed with http-server.
It's a very simple website with a few pages, and it should be updated regularly.
Features to come soon (in order of priority) include:

* Mobile support

* Animations:
   * Smoother transitions on photos, embedded content
   * Loading animation on pages

* Awesome videos of me playing music

* ssh with auto certificate renewal

* A contact form

* 'Project' contribution page for contributed work on open source projects
