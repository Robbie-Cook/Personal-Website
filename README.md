# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with React (create-react-app), and deployed with a static server.
It's a very simple website with a few pages, and it should be updated regularly.

I'm hoping to start with introducing more simple features, then move into making the website smooter
with animations. 
Then I want to start making open source contributions to cool projects, and showcase the contributions
on this website.
Then I want to hook it up to a CMS system for GUI updates, so I can make changes without
having to modify the code.

## Features to come

* Mobile support
  * Fix navigation bar for mobile (bug)
  * Fix music page on mobile (bug)
  * Make basic components responsive
  
* Fix overflow on home page (bug)  
  
* Check email client forwarding properly to personal email

* Animations:
   * Smoother transitions on photos, embedded content
   * Loading animation on pages

* Awesome videos of me playing music

* ssh with auto certificate renewal

* 'Project' contribution page for contributed work on open source projects

* Migrate site to Gatsby to hook up a CMS
  * Make a tutorial site with Gatsby to get a feel
  * Babel?

* Blog integration
