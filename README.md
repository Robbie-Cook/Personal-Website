# Personal Website

This is a repository of my personal website [http://robbie.pw](http://robbie.pw), built with React (create-react-app), and deployed with a static server.

It's a very simple website with a few pages, and it should be updated regularly.

Some key dependencies that this project makes use of are:
      * React styled-components
            I use styled-components a lot in this website. It allows me to apply CSS directly to components, and it
            comes with a SASS-like preprocessor, which allows me to define CSS for child elements      
      * Material-UI
            Currently implementing this for the Navbar (i.e. AppBar, a la material-ui)
            This UI is beautiful and extensible, and has many advantages over bootstrap, which is
            what is being phased out of my website.

In the near future, I want to make this website smoother with animations. 

Then I want to start making open source contributions to cool projects, and showcase the contributions
on this website.

Then I want to hook it up to a CMS system for GUI updates, so I can make changes without
having to modify the code, perhaps with Gatsby?

## Features to come

* Fix browsing directly to /about or /music via url not working 
   - seems to be working on localhost now, not on server 

* Polish home screen
   * Fix misalignment of home page on mobile (bug/feature)
   * Polish home page just like on OneNote now

* Add awesome videos of me playing music

* 'Project' contribution page for contributed work on open source projects

### Polishing

   * Elastic ends of pages for mobile
   * Smoother transitions on photos, embedded content
   * Loading animation on pages

* ssh with auto certificate renewal

* Migrate site to Gatsby to hook up a CMS
  * Make a tutorial site with Gatsby to get a feel
