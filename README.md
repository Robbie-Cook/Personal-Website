# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with React (create-react-app), and deployed with serve.
It's a very simple website with a few pages, and it should be updated regularly.
Features to come soon include:

* Better styling for Music and About pages
   - Look at making styling consistent
* Mobile support
* Smoother transitions on photos and embedded content
* Awesome videos of me playing music
* ssh with auto certificate renewal
* A contact form
* 'Project' contribution page for contributed work on open source projects
